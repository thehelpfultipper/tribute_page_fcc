Find a detailed walkthrough in the blog post on The Helpful Tipper blog (^_^)

**User story requirements:**

1. `#main` container in the body
2. `#title` with heading for tribute subject
3. `#img-div` container with #image for the visual and `#img-caption` for the caption
4. the image should be responsive and centered
5. `#tribute-info` container with text
6. `#tribute-link` anchor that opens to a new page

The tribute subject I chose is Khalil Gibran, the man who inspired me to “not love half-lovers” and “not live a half-life”. If you haven’t heard of him, you’ll know more than your fair share following this challenge!
